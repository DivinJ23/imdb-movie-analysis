# IMDb Movie Analysis (2021 Movies)

This project analyzes IMDbâ€™s processed dataset for English-language feature films released in 2021. It includes data cleaning, and multiple visualizations (scatterplots, bar charts, density plots). I adapted the project scope away from IMDb scraping to focus on reproducible analysis using a cleaned dataset.
